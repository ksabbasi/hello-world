# hello-world
This is my first, in fact 2nd, GitHub project, and is intended to learn how to use GitHub.


I created a test project earlier, but didn't do much into that.

Now, found a tutorial on the GitHub, and following that so as to learn properly how to use GitHub.

It is a very nice tutorial, you can also follow if you haven't created your first project yet.
